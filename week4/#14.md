Secret Sharing
Try out Shamir secret sharing
1. Create a polynomial with the secret being the constant term a0, the other a
values (a1. . . a4) can be chosen at random
The polynomial will be of the form
y(x) = a4x^4 + a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0
    suppose a0=4, random a1...a4 are 3,7,5,8,
    y= 8x^4 + 5x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x + 4

2. Calculate the y values for five x values by evaluating the polynomial, these are
the shares.
(1,27),(2,206),(3,859),(4,2496),(5,5819)

3. Reconstruct the polynomial using those shares and an online interpolation
