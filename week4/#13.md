1. Imagine you get the following trace
    0,2,4,6,8,10,12
    from your program (which simply adds 2 to the previous value.)
    Write out the constraints for this trace, in terms of i, j

    answer:
    A0,1=0;
    ∀0 >= i <= 5 : Ai+1,1 − Ai,1 − 2 = 0;
    A6,1-12;

2. Polynomial practice
    for p(x) = x^3 − 5x^2 − 4x + 20
    a) find an integer root a , i.e. (clue < 7)
    b) write this in terms of a lower degree polynomial q(x)
    such as p(x) = (x − a)q(x)
    What are the degrees of p(x) and q(x)?
    Note we are doing this over the real numbers, for zkps we would use a finite
    field

    answer:
    a) 5
    b) q(x)=x^2-4
    p(x)=(x-5)(x^2-4)
    degree of p(x) : 2
    degree of q(x) : 3
