   a) 4 + 4
   b) 3 x 5
   c) what is the inverse of 3 ?

   answer:
   a) 1
   b) 1
   c) 5

2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
   Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

   answer: Yes, they satisfies the Group theory

3. What is
   -13 mod 5 ?
   2

4. Polynomials

   Find a the positive root ?
   What is the degree of this polynomial ?

   answer: the root is 2; degree is 3

Use cases
In your teams discuss any systems you have used that involved zero knowledge
proofs.
Tornado Cash. Prove a person is able to deposit a certain amount of money without reveal the identity of the person.

Have you seen any applications of zero knowledge proofs other than with a
blockchain ?
What is to you, the most important feature of zkp technology ?
No need to reveal my identity while being able to prove I have certain identity

Think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs that you would like to see
developed.
A real anonymous proposols/posts in a DAO/Community ( administors can only know it's from someone in the community but will theoretically don't know who the proposer/poster is)
