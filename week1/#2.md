1. Modular arithmetic - you just need to find examples, you don't need to prove
anything.
    1. Is it true that all odd squares are â‰¡ 1 (mod 8) ?
        Answer: Yes. ( consider the odd number n=2k+1, then sqare of n is 4k^2+4k+1=4k(k+1)+1,one of the k or k+1 must be even, so is divisible by 8 )
    2.what about even squares (mod 8) ?
        Answer, all even squares (mod 8) will be either 0 or 4
